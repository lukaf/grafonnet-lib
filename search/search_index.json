Instead of generating JSON files and maintaining them, you can easily create your own dashboards using the many helpers grafonnet-lib offers you, thanks to the data templating language jsonnet . Grafana dashboard Grafana is using JSON as format for the dashboards. While this choice makes sense from a technical point of view, people who want to keep those dashboards under version control end up putting large, independent JSON files under source control. When doing so, it is hard to maintain the same links, templates, or even annotation between graphes. It usually requires a lot of custom tooling to change and keep those Json files aligned. There are alternatives, like grafanalib , that makes thing easier. However, as Grafonnet is using jsonnet , a superset of Json, it gives you out of the box a very easy way to use any feature of grafana that would not be covered by Grafonnet already. Scope Grafonnet aims at supporting any basic feature of dashboards (annotations, templates, rows, panels...) as well as a number of datasources and plugins. Code of Conduct Grafonnet is developed withing the Grafana community. Therefore we are following the same Code of Conduct as Grafana .
